# Introduction




## Archive - Delete

This section holds the placeholder information that will be deleted after the book is built.

We have a nice figure in Figure \@ref(fig:hello), and also a table in Table \@ref(tab:iris).

```{r hello, fig.cap='Hello World!', out.width='90%'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, .1))
plot(cars, pch = 19)
```

```{r iris}
knitr::kable(
  head(iris), caption = 'The boring iris data.',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```
